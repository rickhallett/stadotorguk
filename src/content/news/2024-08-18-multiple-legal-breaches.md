The Shore Road consultation failure has opened Swanage Town Council to a cascade of potential legal challenges, according to the complaint. It details a "multi-layered breach" of statutory law, including potential discrimination claims under the Equality Act 2010 for failing to provide reasonable adjustments. Furthermore, the complaint asserts the council may have violated UK GDPR by implementing a significant data-processing change without conducting a required Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), inviting scrutiny from the Information Commissioner's Office for failures in fairness and data protection by design.
