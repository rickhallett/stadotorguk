title: "Who Gave the Order? Swanage Council Faces Transparency Failure Accusations"
published: true

The formal complaint against Swanage Town Council highlights a profound lack of transparency, alleging there is no official record of who authorized the restrictive CAPTCHA, when the decision was made, or on what evidence it was based. This absence of a paper trail is presented as a breach of laws like the Local Government Act 1972, effectively shielding the decision from public scrutiny. The complaint directly challenges the council's Monitoring Officer to produce the official written record, questioning the legality of a decision that fundamentally altered public participation without accountability.
