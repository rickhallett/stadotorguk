Beyond procedural failures, the deepest impact of the Shore Road consultation may be the severe erosion of public trust. The complaint argues that when residents, particularly vulnerable groups, feel their own council has blocked their participation, it undermines the very concept of local democracy.

Experts warn that rebuilding this lost trust could take far longer than fixing any technical issue.
