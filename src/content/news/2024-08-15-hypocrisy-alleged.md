A charge of hypocrisy lies at the heart of the formal complaint, which claims Swanage Town Council's actions fly in the face of its own stated policies. The complaint alleges a breach of the council's constitutional commitments to equality, inclusivity, and proper community engagement. By erecting a digital barrier known to disproportionately exclude elderly and disabled residents, the council is accused of undermining the very principles it purports to uphold, creating a damaging gap between its published values and its practices that erodes public confidence.
