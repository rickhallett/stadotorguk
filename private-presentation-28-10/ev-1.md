Chair, Councillors, thank you for allowing me to speak.
I am addressing the council today in my personal capacity as a resident of Swanage.
At the last full council meeting, I was making a point on a particular matter. In doing so, I mentioned—without placing any great emphasis on it—that Swanage Town Council and the Dorset Coast Forum had conducted a private presentation for the occupants of a private residential address on De Moulham Road. This was in addition to the four publicized drop-in events for the Green Seafront and Shore Road Enhancement Schemes. I believe this private meeting took place in the last week of May, although I am awaiting confirmation of the exact date and which officials were in attendance.
Upon stating this fact, Mr. Mayor, you reacted with clearly visible puzzlement. I have rewatched the footage of the meeting several times to ensure my interpretation of your reaction was correct.
As the leader of the council and a key driver of its major projects and public engagements, are we to assume that you were unaware that such an event took place? If so, why?
Furthermore, I would like to ask the entire council if any representative here wishes to explain why such an event took place and the reasoning behind it.
Although I am currently aware of only one such private event, could the council confirm if any other similar events have occurred and provide the justification for them?
I raise this matter in this public assembly because I have been in correspondence with a significant number of residents who are deeply concerned about the proposed changes to parking and traffic flow in their area. Due to their commitments, many were unable to attend the public engagement events, which were held at inconvenient times for those working a 9-to-5 schedule or for parents with work and school commitments. These residents wish to understand why they were not also approached for a private audience with the council and the Dorset Coast Forum.
If the council does not wish to answer now, I am happy to put these questions in writing to the Town Clerk for your further consideration.

"I address this full council, as every member here is charged with upholding the fairness and integrity of our democratic processes.
My question is for the Town Clerk and it concerns a serious contradiction.
Mr. Town Clerk, in a previous conversation, you stated unequivocally that you did not trust the 'unaccounted, unassigned dots' from the recent survey. Your reasoning was clear: they were left on paper for a week, unsecured, and outside the custody of the neutral facilitator, the Dorset Coast Forum.
Yet, in your public justification today, you completely trivialised the impact and statistical weight of these 'dots'. This misses the point entirely.
The point is this: That survey was commissioned to be the foundation for our District Councillors' case to County Hall for a limited pot of Dorset-wide highways funding. It was supposed to be a true and accurate representation of public will.
But many residents already believe this council has a pre-set agenda: to have Shore Road reduced to one-way or closed completely.
When you, our Town Clerk, privately question the survey's integrity but publicly dismiss those same irregularities, it undermines the entire exercise. It feeds the concern that this was not a robust process, but a tool to serve a corporate agenda.
This isn't just my view. Mr. Milner confirmed to me that he also raised his disagreement with the 'dots' methodology directly with the program initiators.
So, Mr. Town Clerk, I ask you directly: How do you reconcile your private concerns about the survey's flaws with your public dismissal of them today?"
