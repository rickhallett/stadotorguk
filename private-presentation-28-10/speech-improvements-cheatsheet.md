# Speech Improvements Cheat Sheet

## CRITICAL FIXES

**EVIDENCE GAPS** - Both speeches lack specific documentation that allows easy rebuttal
- Speech 1: Replace "I believe this meeting took place" → state exact date or say "occurred in late May per council records"
- Speech 1: "awaiting confirmation" shows incomplete prep → research before speaking or don't mention
- Speech 2: "in a previous conversation" → give exact date, format (email/phone/in-person), and whether documented
- Speech 2: "you completely trivialised" → quote exact words or it's just your interpretation, not fact

**BURIED LEDES** - Most powerful points hidden in middle of paragraphs
- Speech 1: Mayor's puzzlement (line 4-5) should open the speech → "Mr. Mayor, your visible confusion at the last meeting when I mentioned the De Moulham presentation suggests you were unaware. As council leader, why didn't you know?"
- Speech 2: The contradiction is the story → open with "Dr. Ayres wrote on [DATE] that he didn't trust the survey dots. At the Oct 20 meeting, he defended the same survey. I'll ask him to reconcile this."

**NO CLEAR DEMANDS** - Questions without specific asks invite vague bureaucratic responses
- Add to Speech 1: "I request a formal inquiry into who authorized this private event and why other residents weren't offered the same accommodation"
- Add to Speech 2: "I request written explanation by Nov 1st reconciling your September concerns with your October defense of the survey"

## STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

**HEDGING LANGUAGE** - Undermines your credibility and gives council easy outs
- Delete: "without placing any great emphasis on it" (line 3) → if not important, why mention? If important, don't minimize
- Delete: "I believe this private meeting took place" → either confirm or don't claim
- Delete: "my opinion is that particular council members" → state facts or cite specific evidence
- Replace uncertainty with: "Council records show..." / "The Oct 20 meeting minutes state..." / "Freedom of information request #2024-XXX confirms..."

**WEAK OPENING** - Too much procedural throat-clearing before getting to substance
- Current: "Chair, Councillors, thank you... I am addressing the council... in my personal capacity... At the last full council meeting, I was making a point on a particular matter..."
- Better: "Chair, Councillors, thank you. I have three questions about the private De Moulham Road presentation. First..."
- Best opening for Speech 2: "I address this council as members charged with democratic integrity. The Town Clerk contradicted himself on survey validity. Here's the evidence."

**PASSIVE VOICE** - Makes you sound tentative instead of authoritative
- "I was making a point" → "I stated" / "I asked" / "I challenged"
- "Such an event took place" → "The council held this event"
- "This issue will be pursued" → "I will pursue this issue" or "Residents will pursue this"

## PERSUASION GAPS

**NO HUMAN STORIES** - Abstract "residents" don't create emotional connection or media interest
- Add specific examples: "Sarah Thompson, a night-shift nurse, couldn't attend daytime meetings. Why wasn't she offered a home visit like De Moulham residents?"
- "The Chen family, Shore Road residents for 30 years, have three young children. No childcare means they couldn't attend evening sessions. Why were they excluded?"
- Real names + real circumstances = media coverage and council discomfort with appearing unfair

**MISSING RHETORICAL DEVICES** - Speeches read like emails, not compelling oral advocacy
- Rule of Three: "I have three questions that demand answers" (then list exactly three)
- Repetition: "Why wasn't Sarah contacted? Why wasn't the Johnson family contacted? Why wasn't I contacted?"
- Contrast: "Four public meetings for thousands. One private meeting for select few on De Moulham Road."
- The Pause: "Mr. Mayor, you appeared puzzled. [pause] You lead this council. [pause] How did you not know?"
- The Turn: "I came prepared to accept this was simple accommodation for elderly residents. But when the council can't even say who approved it..."

**LOGIC GAPS** - Arguments that don't hold together under scrutiny
- Speech 2 problem: If the dots were unreliable, shouldn't they be dismissed? Your argument seems to be both "dots are bad" and "dismissing dots is bad"
- Fix: Clarify you're challenging the inconsistency, not the decision → "If you privately questioned the dots in Sept, why didn't you demand the survey be redone before using it for policy?"
- Make the logical chain explicit: Flawed methodology → Town Clerk knew → Survey used anyway → Suggests predetermined outcome

**ANTICIPATE REBUTTALS** - Council will deflect; have counter-arguments ready
- If they say "elderly accommodation": "Then why not mail survey to all elderly/disabled residents instead of single private meeting?"
- If they say "misunderstood context": "I'm happy to provide the written record. Do you stand by your Sept statement about unreliable dots or not?"
- If they defer to staff: "With respect, this is a policy question for elected members, not administrative detail"
- If they invoke privacy: "I'm not asking about individual residents, I'm asking about the decision-making process"

## DELIVERY IMPROVEMENTS

**GRAMMAR/STYLE CLEANUP**
- Line 7: Delete awkward parenthetical "(current best information suggests it was only one)" → just say "one private event" or research the exact number
- Line 13: Break up run-on sentence → "In a Sept conversation, you stated you didn't trust the dots. Your reasoning: they were unsecured for a week."
- Line 15: "The point is this: That survey" → "The point is this survey" (drop "that")
- Line 17: Fix parallelism → "not a robust process designed to capture public will, but a tool to justify predetermined decisions"

**TONE CALIBRATION** - Currently too formal/bureaucratic, needs more controlled passion
- Keep respectful but add conviction: "I recognize consultation is hard. But this isn't hard. This is choosing to give some residents private access while forcing others to rearrange work and childcare."
- Show you're representing others: "I'm here because five residents contacted me this week asking the same question: why them and not us?"
- Acknowledge good faith while maintaining challenge: "I don't question your intentions. I question whether this process meets the standards Swanage residents deserve."

**OVERLY DRAMATIC LANGUAGE** - Weakens credibility with council moderates
- Delete: "corporate agenda" (line 17) → too activist, too vague. Corporate how? Which corporations?
- Replace with specific concern: "agenda predetermined without genuine regard for public input" or "process designed to validate rather than inform decisions"
- "Bureaucratic overreach" (PDF) → stick to facts: "decision to hold private presentation without public notice or equal access"

## STRATEGIC ADDITIONS

**ESTABLISH PATTERN** - Single incidents can be dismissed; patterns cannot
- "Is this the only time select residents received private consultations this council didn't disclose? I'm requesting records of all private briefings on Shore Road since Jan 2024."
- "Mr. Milner also questioned the dots methodology. How many other people raised concerns that were acknowledged privately but dismissed publicly?"

**CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY TRAIL** - Force documented responses
- End with: "I'm asking publicly because written inquiries haven't received substantive answers. For the record, I will submit FOI request #[NUMBER] and share all responses publicly."
- "I'm recording today's meeting as is my right in public session. The questions I've asked will be shared with [local media outlet] and posted at [website]."

**FRAME AS PROCESS NOT PERSONAL** - Makes it harder to dismiss as vendetta
- "This isn't about any individual councillor. It's about whether consultation processes are equitable and transparent. Today's answer will set precedent for every future consultation."
- "I want to work with this council to improve community engagement. But I need honest answers about what went wrong here so it doesn't happen again."

**GIVE COUNCIL AN OUT** - Paradoxically strengthens your position
- "If this was a genuine mistake in judgment, say so and commit to better process. If there was legitimate reason, explain it. What erodes trust is evasion."
- "I'm offering the benefit of the doubt. But silence or deflection will confirm residents' worst suspicions about this council's transparency."

## TIMING & SEQUENCING

**DON'T DELIVER BOTH AT SAME MEETING** - Looks orchestrated, invites dismissal as theater
- Meeting 1: Speech about private presentation only
- After meeting: Submit written version to Town Clerk within 48 hours
- Meeting 2: If response inadequate, refined version + new evidence
- Meeting 3: After survey results released, speech about Town Clerk contradiction
- Each builds on documented record of council's previous responses

**FRONT-LOAD KEY QUESTIONS** - In case you're cut off for time
- Assume you have 2 minutes not 3
- Put most important question first: "Was the Mayor aware of the De Moulham event before I mentioned it publicly?"
- Secondary questions can be submitted in writing if time runs out

## DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE SPEAKING**
- Screenshot/print all evidence referenced in speech
- Submit FOI requests 2 weeks before if you'll reference their responses
- Record previous council meetings you'll cite
- Get written confirmation from corroborating witnesses (Mr. Milner)
- Research: Who attended De Moulham event? What was presented? Who authorized it?

**DURING MEETING**
- Bring written copy of speech and hand to clerk for record
- Note which councillors are present/absent
- Record meeting (legal in public session)
- Note who responds, who stays silent, who looks uncomfortable
- Don't accept "I'll get back to you" - request specific deadline

**AFTER MEETING**
- Email summary of questions within 24hrs to Town Clerk, CC all councillors
- Request written response with specific deadline (7 days reasonable)
- Share video clip on social media with timestamp of your questions
- Contact local reporters with transcript and context
- Document any informal responses or corridor conversations

## POWER MOVES

**THE RECEIPTS** - Physical evidence creates pressure
- Hold up printed email while saying "In this Sept 23 email, the Town Clerk wrote..."
- Display council meeting screenshot showing Mayor's reaction
- Hand clerk written copy: "For the public record, I'm submitting this question in writing"

**THE NAMED WITNESS** - Corroboration prevents dismissal
- "Mr. Milner is in this room. He can confirm he also raised these concerns with Dorset Coast Forum."
- "Councillor [X], you attended the De Moulham event. Can you explain the decision-making?"

**THE MEDIA SIGNAL** - Implies broader audience
- "I've shared this question with [newspaper] ahead of tonight's meeting"
- "This speech will be posted in full at [website] immediately after this meeting"
- Don't overdo it - sounds threatening rather than transparent

**THE CHOICE** - Binary frame that's hard to dodge
- "Either the survey methodology was sound or it wasn't. The Town Clerk cannot have it both ways."
- "This council has a choice: explain the process now or allow this to undermine every future consultation."

**THE REDIRECT** - When they try to defer to staff
- "With respect, who authorized the private event is an administrative question. Why the council thought it appropriate is a policy question for elected members."

## FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE SPEAKING

- [ ] Speech under 3 minutes when read aloud slowly
- [ ] Every claim backed by specific evidence (date, document, witness)
- [ ] At least one concrete human example with name (with their permission)
- [ ] Clear demand for specific action with specific deadline
- [ ] Most important question in first 60 seconds
- [ ] Anticipated top 3 deflections with counter-arguments
- [ ] Tone is firm but respectful (no insults, no conspiracy theories)
- [ ] Written version ready to hand to clerk
- [ ] FOI requests drafted to submit immediately after
- [ ] Recording device tested and positioned
- [ ] Local journalist aware you're speaking and on what topic
- [ ] Ally in room who can follow up if you're cut off
- [ ] Practiced delivery with harsh critic who caught ambiguities

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Immediate** - Council forced to give specific answer or specific non-answer (both useful)
**Short-term** - Written response that creates accountability trail for next challenge
**Medium-term** - Media coverage that brings broader public attention
**Long-term** - Policy change, formal inquiry, or precedent that improves future consultations

Success isn't "winning the argument in the room." Success is creating documented record that builds case for change and makes continued evasion politically costly.
