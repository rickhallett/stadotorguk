# Implementation Report: Prevent Duplicate Form Submissions
## Date: 2025-08-30
## PRD: 020-prevent-duplicate-submissions.prd.md

## Tasks Completed
- [x] **Add `getLeadByEmail` function to `src/utils/database.ts`**: This function checks if an email already exists in the database.
  - Commit: `13d8ae7 feat(db): add getLeadByEmail function`
  - Files: `src/utils/database.ts`
- [x] **Update API to prevent duplicate email submissions**: The `/api/submit-lead` endpoint now uses `getLeadByEmail` to check for existing emails and returns a 409 conflict error if a duplicate is found.
  - Commit: `2c071d9 feat(api): prevent duplicate email submissions`
  - Files: `src/pages/api/submit-lead.ts`
- [x] **Update UI to prevent multiple submissions from the same device**: The `SignUpForm` component now uses `localStorage` to check if a user has already submitted the form and displays a confirmation message instead of the form if they have.
  - Commit: `8c3861e feat(ui): prevent multiple form submissions from same device`
  - Files: `src/components/react/SignUpForm.tsx`

## Testing Summary
- No automated tests were added as part of this implementation.
- Manual verification is required to ensure the new functionality works as expected.

## Challenges & Solutions
- There were no significant challenges during this implementation. The process was straightforward as outlined in the PRD.

## Next Steps
- Manually test the form submission process to verify that duplicate submissions are prevented.
- Test the API endpoint directly to ensure it returns a 409 conflict error for duplicate emails.
